Nest is a decentralized AI system powered by four interconnected modules, delivering emergent behavior through collective computation. Like a nest, each module functions as a piece of a greater network.

System Architecture
interface HiveArchitecture {
  particleSystem: {
    state: ParticleState[];
    behavior: HiveBehavior;
    physics: PhysicsEngine;
  };
  
  neuralNetwork: {
    nodes: NeuralNode[];
    connections: Connection[];
    learningRate: number;
  };
  
  visualization: {
    renderer: WebGLRenderer;
    camera: Camera;
    scene: Scene;
  };
}

Particle System Configuration
interface HiveConfig {
  particleCount: number;
  particleSpeed: number;
  connectionDistance: number;
  targetForce: number;
  maxSpeed: number;
  friction: number;
  repulsion: number;
  behavior: HiveBehavior;
}
